# Bash Scripting #

**arithmetic operations**

```shell
## needs double parenthesis

## does only integer arithmetic
f=$((1/3))
echo $f

## will do floating point arithmetic
g=$(echo 1/3 | bc -l)
echo $g 
```  

**arrays**

```shell
a=() 
b=("apple" "banana" "cherry") # notice no commas ! 
echo ${b[2]} 
b[5]="kiwi" # don't have to populate every element.
b+=("mango") # append at the end, paranthesis is important.
# outputs the whole array
echo ${b[@]}
echo ${b[@]: -1}
```

**associative arrays**
`bash > 3.0`

```shell
declare -A myarray
myarray[color]=blue
myarray["office building"]="HQ West"

echo ${myarray["office building"]} is ${myarray[color]}
```

**brace  expansion**

```shell
$touch {apple, banana, cherry, durian} 
$touch file_{01..1000} # zero padding. 

echo {A..Z}
echo {a..Z}
echo {A..z}
echo {w..d..2}

touch {apple, banana, cherry, durian}_{01..100}{w..d}
```

**colouring options**

`echo -e "\033[5;31;40mERROR: \033[0m\033[31;40mSomething went wrong.\033[0m"`

```shell
flashred="\033[5;31;40m"
red="\033[31;40m"
none="\033[0m"
echo -e $flashred"ERROR: "$none$red"Something went wrong."$none 

## Also, can use "tput" notation 

flashred=$(tput setab 0; tput setaf 1; tput blink) 
red=$(tput setab 0; tput setaf 1) 
none=$(tput sgr 0) 

echo -e $flashred"ERROR: "$none$red"Something went wrong."$none 
```

**comparison operations**

`[["cat" == "cat" ]]` - returns 1 failure or 0 success  
`echo $?` - return value 

`[[ $a -lt $b]]` - used for integers !!  other comparison will be lexically. 

String is null or not.  
```shell
[[ -z $a && -n $b ]] # a is null and b is not null 
echo $? # returns result of the last comparison. 0 - success, 1 - failure.
```

**control structures**

```shell
if expression 
then 
    echo "True"
elif expression; then
    echo "ex is False, e2 is True"
fi
```

**debugging**

```shell
# quick debugging 
# this will produce some interesting output information 
 
#!/bin/bash -x 

# verbose logging
#!/bin/bash -xv 
 
# a quick check to see if any arguments were given 
# raise warning if argument/file not given. 
 
if [$1 = ]; then 
    echo "no arguments given" 
    exit 0 
fi 
 
# this loop iterates through all of the files that we gave the program 
# it does one rename per file given. 
 
for file in $*; do 
    mv ${file} $prefix$file 
done
```

**declare**

```shell
declare -i d=123 # d is an integer
declare -r e=456 # e is read-only
declare -l f="LOLcats" # f is lolcats
declare -u g="LOLCATS" # g is LOLCATS
```

**exit codes**

``` shell
#!/bin/bash  
 
touch /root/test 2> /dev/null  
 
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then  
    echo "Successfully created file"  
    exit 0  
else  
    echo "Could not create file" >&2  
    exit 1  
fi
```

**file i/o**

```shell
echo "some text" > file.txt
cat file.txt
> file.txt
echo "some more text" >> file.txt
```
```shell
i=1
while read f; do
    echo "Line $i: $f"
    ((i++))
done < file.txt
```

**here document**

to help display instructions:
```shell
cat << EndOfText
This is a 
multiline
text string
EndOfText
```
use `-` to remove tabs from following string.

```shell
ftp -n <<- DoneWithTheUpdate
    open mirrors.xmission.com
    user anonymous nothinghere
    ascii
    cd gutenberg
    get GUTINDEX.01
    bye
DoneWithTheUpdate
```

**interacting with the user**

> working with arguments

arguments are assigned the way they are passed - `$1`, `$2`, etc.  

for large number of arguments use `$@` and `$#`.
```shell
for i in $@; do
    echo $i
done

echo "There were $# arguments."
```

> working with flags

```shell
#!/bin/bash -xv

help_message(){
printf "Usage\t$0\n"
printf "\t-u:\tUser\t\tdefault: user\n"
printf "\t-p:\tPassword\tdefault: password\n"
}

default_values(){
user="user"
pass="pass"
}

if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
    help_message
    exit 0
fi

default_values

while getopts :u:p:ab option; do
 case $option in
  u) user=$OPTARG;;
  p) pass=$OPTARG;;
  a) echo "Got the A flag!";;
  b) echo "Got the B flag!";;
  ?) echo "I don't know what &OPTARG is!";;
 esac
done

echo "User: $user / Pass: $pass"
```

> getting input during execution

```shell
echo "What is your name?"
read name

## silent mode - typed text will not appear. 
echo "What is your password?"
read -s pass

## inlne prompt
read -p Waht is your favourite animal? " animal

echo name: $name, pass: $pass, animal: $animal
```

Look at this [link](http://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/sect_08_02.html) for other options.

```shell
## this will produce a menued list
select animal in "cat" "dog" "bird" "fish"; do 
    echo "You selected $animal!"
    break
done
```

```shell
## using a case block can be useful
select animal in "cat" "dog" "quit"; do 
    case $option in
    cat) echo "Cats like to sleep.";;
    dog) echo "Dogs like to play catch.";;
    quit) break;;
    *) echo "I'm not sure what that is.";;
    esac
done
```

> ensuring a response

```shell
#!/bin/bash 

if [#t -lt 3]; then
    cat <<- EOM
    This command requires three arguments:
    username, userid, and favourite number.
    EOM
else
 ## the program goes here
    echo "Username: #1"
    echo "UserID: $2"
    echo "Favourite Number: $3"
fi
```

```shell
read -p "Favourite animal? " a
while [[ -z "$a" ]]; do
    read -p "I need an answer! " a
done
echo "$a was selected."
```

```shell
read -p "Favourite animal?[cat] " a
## the -z option checks that the variable is not empty
while [[ -z "$a" ]]; do
    a="cat"
done
echo "$a was selected."
```

```shell
## basic validation using regex
read -p "What year? [nnnn] " a
while [[ ! $a =~ [0-9]{4} ]]; do
    read -p "A year, please! [nnnn] " a
done
echo "Selected year: $a"
```

**redirecting output**

```shell
$ cp -v * ../otherFolder 1> ../success.txt 2> ../error.txt 
1> stdout ; 2> stderr 

# will redirect stdout and stderr to output.log
bash my.file.sh > output.log 2>&1
```

**working with strings**

```shell
a="hello "
b="world"
c=$a$b
echo $c # concatenated string

echo ${#a} # length of string
echo ${c:3} # substring from third character
echo ${c:3:4}
echo ${c: -4}
echo ${c: -4:3}

## string replacement
fruit="apple banana banana cherry"
echo ${fruit/banana/durian} # only first instance is replaced
echo ${fruit//banana/durian} # all instances are replaced

echo ${fruit/#apple/durian} # replace only if instance occurs at very beginning of string
echo $fruit/%cherry/durian} # replace only if instance occurs at end of string
```

**running scripts smoothly**

```
set -euo pipefail

-e: Exit immediately if any command exits with a non-zero status (i.e. an error). 
  This ensures that errors are caught early and the script does not continue 
  to run in an unexpected state.
-u: Treat unset variables as errors and exit immediately. This helps catch errors 
  where a variable is not defined or set correctly.
-o pipefail: Causes a pipeline to fail if any of the commands in the pipeline fail, 
  rather than just the last command. This ensures that errors in any command in a 
  pipeline are caught and the script does not continue to run in an unexpected state.

Taken together, these options help to ensure that your Bash script runs more safely
and predictably, catching errors and unexpected behavior early and exiting the script 
immediately to prevent further issues.
```

## Up and Running Notes ##

`bash` major differences: http://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/bash/bashref.html#SEC138

ENV. Variables : `$MACHTYPE`, `$HOSTNAME`, `$BASH_VERSION`, `$SECONDS`

`/dev/null` ! Great blue nowhere 

`echo $SECONDS` - time script has been running.  
`echo $0` - script name. 

```shell
a=$(ping -c 1 example.com | grep 'bytes from' | cut -d = -f 4)
echo "The ping was $a"
```

`echo -e '\033[34;42mColorTest\033[0m'` - try it.  

```shell
date +"%d-%m-%Y"
date +"%H:%M:%S"
```

`printf "Name:\t%s\nID:\t%04d\n" "asif" "7"`

```shell
today=$(date +"%d-%m-%Y")
time=$(date +"%H:%M:%S")
printf -v d "Current User:\t%s\nDate:\t\t%s @ %s\n" $USER $today $time
echo $d
```

One would write the below text in a file:
```shell
open mirrors.xmission.com
user anonymous nothinghere
ascii
cd gutenberg
get GUTINDEX.00
```
and then pass that file to something like `ftp` to execute line by line - `ftp -n < ftp.txt`

```shell
freespace=$(df -h / | grep -E "\/$" | awk '{print $4}')
greentext="\033[32m"
bold="\033[1m"
normal="\033[0m"
logdate=$(date +"%Y%m%d")
logfile="$logdate"_report.log

echo -e $bold"Quick system report for "$greentext"$HOSTNAME"$normal
printf "\tSystem type:\t%s\n" $MACHTYPE
printf "\tBash Version:\t%s\n" $BASH_VERSION
printf "\tFree Space:\t%s\n" $freespace
printf "\tFiles in dir:\t%s\n" $(ls | wc -l)
printf "\tGenerated on:\t%s\n" $(date +"%m/%d/%y) # US date format
echo -e $greentext"A summary of this info has been saved to $logfile"$normal

cat <<- EOF> $logfile
 This report was automatically generated by my Bash script
 It contains a brif summary of some systme information.
EOF

printf "SYS:\t%s\n" $MACHTYPE >> $logfile
printf "BASH:\t%s\n" $BASH_VERSION >> $logfile
```

**How do I upgrade Bash in Mac OSX Mountain Lion and set it the correct path?**
 
Install bash with `brew install bash` .

Add `/usr/local/bin/bash` to `/etc/shells` .

Change the default shell with `chsh -s /usr/local/bin/bash` .

You don't normally have to change any settings in Terminal or iTerm 2. Both of them default to opening new shells with the default login shell.
